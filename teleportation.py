Quantum Teleportation Implementation

This module implements the quantum teleportation protocol. The mathematical foundation
and detailed explanations can be found in html/doc/teleportation_doc.html

Initial State:
- Qubit 0: Message qubit in state |1⟩
- Qubits 1,2: Bell state (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2

The complete state after initialization is:
|ψ⟩ = |1⟩₀ ⊗ (|00⟩ + |11⟩)₁₂/√2 = (|100⟩ + |111⟩)/√2
