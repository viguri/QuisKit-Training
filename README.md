# Quantum Bell State Generator

This project demonstrates the creation and measurement of a Bell state using IBM's Qiskit framework. It implements one of the fundamental quantum circuits that showcases quantum entanglement.

## Overview

The quantum circuit creates a Bell state (specifically the |Φ+⟩ state) using two qubits. This state is a fundamental example of quantum entanglement, where the quantum states of particles are connected in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently.

## Latest Features

- **Enhanced Visualization**: Improved histogram visualization for better understanding of measurement results.
- **Multiple Circuit Implementations**: Added alternative implementations of the Bell state circuit for educational purposes.
- **Integration with Quantum Simulators**: Support for running circuits on various quantum simulators.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Qiskit
- Qiskit Aer (for simulation)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer matplotlib
```

## Installation Instructions

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-bell-state-generator.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd quantum-bell-state-generator
   ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Circuit Description

The implemented quantum circuit:

1. Initializes two qubits in the |0⟩ state
2. Applies a Hadamard gate (H) to the first qubit, creating a superposition
3. Applies a CNOT gate using the first qubit as control and the second as target
4. Measures both qubits

This sequence creates the Bell state:
|Φ+⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2

## Running the Circuit

Execute the circuit by running:

```bash
python first_circuit.py
```

The script will:

1. Create and display the quantum circuit
2. Run the circuit on a quantum simulator
3. Display measurement results
4. Generate a histogram of the results
5. Save the histogram as 'results_histogram.png'

## Understanding the Results

The results demonstrate quantum entanglement through:

- Approximately equal probabilities of measuring |00⟩ and |11⟩ states
- Absence of |01⟩ and |10⟩ states
- Perfect correlation between the qubits' measurements

The histogram visualization ('results_histogram.png') shows the distribution of 1000 measurements, with bars of approximately equal height for the '00' and '11' states.
